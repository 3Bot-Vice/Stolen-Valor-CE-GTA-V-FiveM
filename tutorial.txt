Custom TP tutorial:
For custom Teleports (so not the waypoint), you need to select the teleports, then go in game and walk forward a bit.

Model Changer:
Only other players can see your model, meaning for you, you will still be the same. Go try it with a friend and see.
If some models are just invisible, it's FiveM that isn't rendering them out (I know some dogs have that issue)
Also here is a helpful model list I made for the cheat. Just copy and replace the model hex in the Cheat Table.

Weapon Spawner (Replacer) Tutorial:
- Use infinite ammo and no reload for this, as it is more convenient (you will see why).
- Get one of the 4 weapons provided (knife, bat, pistol, or Combat pistol) and hold it in your hands.
- Once it is in your hands, go ahead and replace it's model hex.
- Just like the model changer, only other people will see the skins, but your character will have an animation as if he is holding the gun.
- If you put the gun away or get in a vehicle, you will not be able to get it back. Simply change the hex back to it's original state to be able to equip the weapon in your hand, and then change it back to whatever weapon you want.
- You will not be able to shoot if you replaced the melee weapons, but you will still hold the guns in your hands like a badass.
- Throwables or RPGs do not work yet, but other weapons, railgun or minigun works fine.

[UPDATED TUTORIAL - READ IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW CHEAT ENGINE WORKS]

What is Cheat Engine?
Cheat Engine is a value editor for softwares. What this cheat essentially allows you to do is modify client side values, which gta has a lot of those. Then the modified client side values will be transmitted to the server. Normally how you would do this without a cheat table is
- search for the specific value and the type (this has already been done for you)
- filter out unwanted values (this has already been done for you)
- bookmark the value (this has already been done for you)
- change the value to whatever you want
- freeze the value so it doesn't change

Basic Tutorial
- Navigate over to Player options, then health, set the value on 200 which is the max gta 5 health
- Press X in the empty box to freeze the value. But, 200 health doesn't give you godmode.
- Headshots and explosions in this game do way more than 200 damage, and even though you freezed the value, it still drops for a split second which is enough to kill you.

Basic Player Options and Weapon Options tutorial
- If you read the God Mode Tutorial and now understand the health thing, you can replicate the same thing for stuff like armor.
- Going into other stuff like walk or swim speed. Don't set those higher than 5, as it isn't efficient anymore.
- Do not tough or edit the "Current Player Coordinates" field as it has nothing to do with teleporting.
- All teleport options are in their own category called "Teleport Options"
- If you don't have NumPad and are wondering how to change gun stuff, open "Weapon Options", there you can put "No Reload", "Unlimited Ammo", and set your "Current Ammo" in the weapon.
- Hint, you need to have the weapon equipped to set your ammo.
- "Damage Multiplier" modifies the damage given by your weapon on a player.
- "Melee Damage Multiplier" modifies your punch damage on vehicles, objects, and players.

More Advanced Weapon Tutorial (Continuation of the Basic Tutorial Above)
- This is a continuation from the two tutorials above. Read them first if you are confused about this.
- In "Weapon Options", open "Custom Explosive Bullets" for changing the bullet type (There is a mini tutorial there)
- If you are interested on how to spawn (replace) guns, read the "Weapon Spawner" tutorial above.
- In "Weapon Options", expand down to "Weapon Mods (Advanced)" where you will see a lot of stuff.
- "Bullet Damage" as an example is how much damage a bullet does.
- Change it to something like 200 and it will be an insta kill gun.
- Change it to 20000 and it will stop cars or blow them up in 1 or 4 bullets (depends on the sync).
- You can build anything here, from rocket launchers that freeze rockets in air, to insta homing guns, velocity, weapon range, etc.

Vehicle Tutorial
- If you open "Vehicle Options", you will see some self explanatory fields.
- Normally "Engine Health 2" is the engine health (which 1000 is the max value)
- The "Vehicle Boost" Has nothing to do with speed, but its for vehicles that have a booster
   on the back (e.g. Batman car).
- That is for the duration of the boost. Change it to from 1.25 to 2.5 and boost will last twice as long.
- When you open "Vehicle Mods (Advanced)" you can modify just about anything on a vehicle. 
- "Acceleration" for example is self explanatory, but making it too high will cause your car to drift a lot.
- You can counter that with "Gravity".  High gravity, means more speed and faster breaking
- Look around and play with stuff, you can build just about anything from flying cars, to wheeling
   cars, to unstoppable faggios that destroy trucks on contact.
- Also do not teleport with the "Current Vehicle Coordinates"

Cheat Engine is a powerfull tool that lets you modify everything that is client side (about 50% of Gta V) If you know how to use it as essentially you have control over everything that is going on client side, which is a huge part of gta 5 and how it was coded. Options are limitless, so have fun, even go ahead and modify the cheat table if you found other values you want to add. Everything is up to you ;)

Thanks for using
